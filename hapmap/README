Example launch of the chr22.pl script.

perl chr22.pl \
        --mask-data \
        --percent-indivs 17 \
        --percent-loci 50 \
        --limit-loci 5000 \
        --pop Eur \
        --states 4 \
        --genotypes-file d1_train.txt \
        --locus-file loci_phased.txt \
        --maskfile d1_test_index.txt \
        --case-control-file d1_test.txt

Let's presume that the source data filenames are:

genotypes_phased.txt
loci_phased.txt



========================================================================
Contents of this directory:

 * chr22.pl:
A convenient script which runs the analysis of chromosome 22

 * convertdata.cc
C++ program to convert raw unphased HapMap data files to HAPMIXMAP
format genotypesfile and locusfile First run sortSNPS and
repairSecondColumn to fix anomalies in the data files.

 * convertphaseddata.cc
C++ program to convert raw phased HapMap data files to HAPMIXMAP format
genotypesfile and locusfile

 * Eur
 * Afr
 * Asian
directories containing data files for each of the three populations in HapMap 

 * FastPhaseConverter.R:
An R script which writes R objects in fastPHASE format.

 * fastphase_kselect
 * hotspotmap.R
 * makefile
makefile for the various programs in this directory

 * makegenotypes.cc
C++ program for setting to missing genotypes in HapMap data at loci not
included in Affymetrix/Illumina chips
[obsolete]

 * maskGenotypes.R
 * maskGenotypesFunctions.R
R script which masks diploid genotype data. It writes both HAPMIXMAP and
fastPHASE data formats.

 * MutualInformation.R:
Script which calculates mutual information from PPGenotypes.txt written
by the HAPMIXMAP program.

 * prepareTestingData.pl:
A script which reads haploid data, takes out a specified percent of
individuals to move to the testing set and writes both files. Training
test is written as a haploid data, testing as diploid data.

 * repairSecondColumn.pl:
Raw data from hapmap have problem with this:
A/G/T AA AG AA GG AG ... (no T anywhere)
This script processes the raw data and repairs it. In this case:
A/G AA AG AA GG AG ...

 * sortSNPs.cc

A short C++ program to sort the HapMap loci by position (some of the
loci in the raw data files are out-of-sequence)
[this shouls be incorporated into convertdata]

 * ranker.h
header file required for sortSNPS.cc
