EXTRA PARAMS FOR THE PROGRAM structure.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PARAMS ARE
IN THE FILE mainparams.

"(int)" means that this takes an integer value.
"(d)"   means that this is a double (ie, a Real number such as 3.14).
"(B)"   means that this variable is Boolean 
        (ie insert 1 for True, and 0 for False).

PROGRAM OPTIONS

#define INFERALPHA  1 // (B) Infer ALPHA (the admixture parameter)
#define FREQSCORR   1 // (B) allele frequencies are correlated among pops
#define ONEFST      1
#define LINKAGE 1
#define SITEBYSITE 1
#define COMPUTEPROB 1 // (B) Estimate the probability of the Data under 
                             the model.  This is used when choosing the 
                             best number of subpopulations.
#define INFERLAMBDA 0
#define NOADMIX     0 // (B) Use no admixture model
doesn't work #define NOADMBURN   0 //(int) initial period of burnin with admixture,
                          before switching to no admixture model.  This 
                          sometimes leads to better convergence.
                          Set this to be less than the value of BURNIN.
#define ADMBURNIN 10

USING PRIOR POPULATION INFO

#define USEPOPINFO  0  // (B) Use prior population information to assist 
                             clustering.  Need POPDATA=1.
#define GENSBACK    1  //(int) For use when inferring whether an indiv-
                         idual is an immigrant, or has an immigrant an-
                         cestor in the past GENSBACK generations.  eg, if 
                         GENSBACK==2, it tests for immigrant ancestry 
                         back to grandparents. 
#define MIGRPRIOR 0.05 //(d) prior prob that an individual is a migrant 
                             (used only when USEPOPINFO==1).  This should 
                             be small, eg 0.01 or 0.1.


OUTPUT OPTIONS

#define PRINTQHAT    1  // (B) Q-hat printed to a separate file.  Turn this 
                           on before using STRAT.
#define UPDATEFREQ   0  // (int) frequency of printing update on the screen.
                                 Set automatically if this is 0.
#define PRINTLIKES   0  // (B) print current likelihood to screen every rep
#define INTERMEDSAVE 0  // (int) number of saves to file during run
#define PRINTKLD     1  // (B) Print estimated Kullback-Leibler diver-
                              gence to screen during the run
#define ECHODATA     1  // (B) Print some of data file to screen to check
                              that the data entry is correct.
  (NEXT 3 ARE FOR COLLECTING DISTRIBUTION OF Q:)
#define ANCESTDIST   0  // (B) collect data about the distribution of an-
                              cestry coefficients (Q) for each individual
#define NUMBOXES   1000 // (int) the distribution of Q values is stored as 
                              a histogram with this number of boxes. 
#define ANCESTPINT 0.90 //(d) the size of the displayed probability  
                              interval on Q (values between 0.0--1.0)

PRIORS

#define ALPHA        1  // (d) Dirichlet parameter for degree of admixture 
                             (this is the initial value if INFERALPHA==1).
not working #define CORRA      2.0  // (d) CORRA, CORRB:  Prior parameters for parameter 
not working #define CORRB      2.0  // (d) controlling size of allele freq correlations.
                             The prior is a Gamma distribution with mean
			     CORRA*CORRB, and variance CORRA*CORRB^2. 
not working #define EPSILON    1.0  // (d) Dirichlet parameter for allele frequencies 
#define UNIFPRIORALPHA 0 // (B) use a uniform prior for alpha;
                                otherwise gamma prior
#define ALPHAMAX    20.0 // (d) max value of alpha if uniform prior
#define ALPHAPRIORA  1.0 // (only if UNIFPRIORALPHA==0): alpha has a gamma 
                            prior with mean A*B, and 
#define ALPHAPRIORB  2.0 // variance A*B^2.  Suggest A=1, B=2 


MISCELLANEOUS

#define ALPHAPROPSD 0.05 //(d) SD of proposal for updating alpha
not working #define FPROPSD     3.0  //(d) SD of proposal for updating freq correls
#define STARTATPOPINFO 0 //Use given populations as the initial condition 
                           for population origins.  (Need POPDATA==1).  It 
                           is assumed that the PopData in the input file 
                           are between 1 and k where k<=MAXPOPS.
#define RANDOMIZE    1  //(B) use new random seed for each run 
#define METROFREQ    10  //(int) Frequency of using Metropolis step to update
                           Q under admixture model (ie use the metr. move every
                           i steps).  If this is set to 0, it is never used.
                           (Proposal for each q^(i) sampled from prior.  The 
                           goal is to improve mixing for small alpha.)
#define REPORTHITRATE 0 //(B) report hit rate if using METROFREQ
