Source training data:
http://www.hapmap.org/downloads/phasing/2006-07_phaseII/phased/

Prerequisites:

 * Perl
 * R-project

Step I. Start a project

$ perl start-project.pl \
	--name <project name> \
	--population <population> \
	--genotypes <genotypes>

Project name should be a single word in lower case characters.
Population can be one of: 'Afr', 'Asian', 'Eur'.  Genotypes file is
optional. If not given at the time of project creation, it should be
placed later on, manually.

Genotypes file format:

idno	dncase	rsXXXX	rsXXXXX	rsXXXXX
<id1>	0	G:A	G:A	C:C
<id2>	1	A:A	G:A	C:T

Columns should be tab-separated. Loci coding should be coded in the same
way as in the Hapmap project.

dncase is 0 for case, 1 for control.

Step II. Pre-process the data.

$ perl pre-process.pl

This step will convert user data into a format suitable for hapmixmap.
It will also download the corresponding file from Hapmap project and
prepare the train data. Any spotted problems with the data will be
reported to the user.

Step III. Train.

$ perl train.pl [ --iterations N ]

This step trains the program, using data downloaded from the Hapmap
project. The algorithm may require few thousands iterations to converge.
The program state is saved after the program stops, so the training
process can be resumed.

Once the algorithm has converged, there is no need to repeat the
training step anymore. New data can be submitted for testing, using the
existing (saved) program state.

Step IV. Test.

$ perl test.pl

This step will process the case-control data. It doesn't require many
iterations.

Step V. Post-process.

$ perl post-process.pl

This step will post-process the outcome data.
