Analysis is performed in directory genepi/trunk/hapmap

 1. Settings

Numbers of states and other variables can be configured in the
config.sh file. Example content:

POPULATIONS="Eur Afr Asian"
STATES_LIST=$(seq 18 -2 2)
SAMPLES=4000

Edit the generate-taskfarm-file.sh to set the percent of masked
individuals and loci.

Source data (phased_genotypes.txt, phased_loci.txt) is expected to be
in:

~/shared-genepi/hapmap

You can create this directory by hand or create a symlink. In my case
the symlink is:

/ichec/home/users/maciej/shared-genepi -> /ichec/work/ndlif006b/genepi

 2. Preparing the data

./generate-taskfarm-file.sh

This command will generate scripts to prepare the data, according to
the configuration from config.sh. Execute masking with the following
command:

bash mutual-information-prep.sh

 3. Running the analysis

 3.1. Sequentially

If you want to execute the analysis sequentially, on a local machine
(not on a cluter), execute this:

bash mutual-information-tf.sh

 3.2. On a cluster

Use the launch-taskfarm.pbs script; edit it and set the walltime.
Submit it:

qsub launch-taskfarm.pbs

 4. Read the results

After the analysis has finished, you can read the results with the
following command:

bash collect-mi.sh

It will display a text table. If you want a table for a Trac wiki,
you can type:

bash collect-mi.sh "" '||'

It will use Trac table syntax, which can be copied and pasted into
Trac wiki pages or ticket comments.

Alternatively, a LaTeX(-ish) table will be produced by:

bash collect-mi.sh "" '&'
