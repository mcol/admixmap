** Instructions for building admixmap and hapmixmap from source**

If installing from Subversion repository, complete all steps. 
If installing from tarfile (genepi-src.tar.gz), skip step 1.
These instructions assume you are working in Unix, Linux, Msys or Cygwin.

1. To create the configure script:
--------------------------------
autoreconf -fi

You will need GNU autoconf v2.59 or newer, GNU automake v1.8 or newer.

You might get warnings about underquoted definitions. These can be safely ignored. They can be suppressed in automake v1.10 or later by adding '-Wno-syntax' to the ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am.

2. To create the makefiles:
-----------------------------
./configure [options]
A full list of options is available by using the option --help. The principal ones are:
--prefix=<where to install>
--enable-optimize
--enable-debug
--enable-profile
--enable-parallel
--enable-shared

Use the -q flag to suppress the output

The configure script will look for Intel and Pathscale compilers first, then GNU g++ then Portland's pgCC. If you have more than one of these available or want to use a different compiler, make sure to use the command 'export CXX=<compiler-name> first. 

By default, no extra flags are passed to the compiler. Use 'export EXTRAFLAGS=...'  ( NB not CXXFLAGS) to do so. 


3. To compile and install:
-----------------------------
make, make install
bcppcl header files will be placed in $PREFIX/bcppcl and the library in $PREFIX/lib
binaries will be placed in $PREFIX/bin
